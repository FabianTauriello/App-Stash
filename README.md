# The Brief:

My third Android application built with Kotlin. 

## Description

App Stash allows users to create a list of their own app ideas. At present, the application only allows users to add app ideas and delete all of them. 

It implements the Model–view–presenter (MVP) architectural pattern, ViewModel architecture component and the Room library for persistence.
